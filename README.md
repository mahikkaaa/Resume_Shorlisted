# Resume_Shortlisted
Automated Resume Screening System for enhancing Recruitment Efficiency and Candidate selection along with analysis of day-wise trends in layoff depending on the company and the country, reduced recruitment time by 50%, and improved candidate selection accuracy by 80%.


**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to develop a text analysis tool that can read a candidate's resume and suggest potential fields or industries that align with their skills and experience. This tool will help job seekers identify potential career paths they may not have previously considered and help recruiters efficiently identify suitable candidates for specific roles.

**Methodology:**
The tool will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information from the resume, such as the candidate's work experience, education, and skills. It will then analyze this information using machine learning algorithms to suggest potential fields or industries that align with the candidate's experience.

_The project will follow the following steps:_
- Collect a large dataset of resumes across various fields and industries.
- Preprocess the resumes to clean and normalize the text data.
- Extract relevant information such as work experience, education, and skills using NLP techniques.
- Develop a machine learning model that can analyze the extracted information and suggest potential fields or industries.
- Train the model on the preprocessed resume dataset.
- Test the model on a separate dataset of resumes and evaluate its accuracy and performance.
- Integrate the model into a user-friendly web application or software tool.

**Expected Output:**
The output of this project will be a web application or software tool that can analyze a candidate's resume and suggest potential fields or industries that align with their skills and experience. The tool will provide job seekers with new career path options and help recruiters identify suitable candidates for specific roles.

**Potential Impact:**
This project has the potential to help job seekers explore new career opportunities and find roles that align with their skills and experience. It can also assist recruiters in identifying suitable candidates for specific roles efficiently. By using a data-driven approach to match job seekers with suitable roles, this project can potentially reduce the time and cost associated with job search and recruitment processes.
